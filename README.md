-------
You will need several pre-requisites installed before compilation will work.  For an automated setup, check out
the [Automatic Building](https://github.com/jarrettchisholm/glr/wiki/Automatic-Building) section of the wiki.

Assuming you have all the pre-requisites ready to go, you can compile by running `python setup.py release` followed by `scons` from the terminal (or
the Developer Command Prompt for VS2013 on Windows).
