To compile, run {\ttfamily scons} from the command line.

{\bfseries Note}\-: You must have a 'lib' directory with the files\-:

{\bfseries Linux}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item libcef.\-so
\item libffmpegsumo.\-so
\item libcef\-\_\-dll\-\_\-wrapper.\-lib
\item libcef\-\_\-dll\-\_\-wrapper
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries Windows}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item libcef.\-dll
\item libcef.\-lib
\item libffmpegsumo.\-dll
\item libcef\-\_\-dll\-\_\-wrapper.\-lib
\end{DoxyItemize}

The libcef\-\_\-dll\-\_\-wrapper is the directory that contains all of the cef\-\_\-dll object files (within their folder heirarchy).

\section*{Compile}

You will need several pre-\/requisites installed before compilation will work. For an automated setup, check out the \href{https://github.com/jarrettchisholm/glr/wiki/Automatic-Building}{\tt Automatic Building} section of the wiki.

Assuming you have all the pre-\/requisites ready to go, you can compile by running {\ttfamily python \hyperlink{setup_8py}{setup.\-py}} followed by {\ttfamily scons} from the terminal (or the Developer Command Prompt for V\-S2013 on Windows).
