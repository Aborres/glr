Compile
=======
To compile, run `scons` from the command line.

**Note**: You must have a 'lib' directory with the files:

**Linux**

-  libcef.so
-  libffmpegsumo.so
-  libcef_dll_wrapper.lib
-  libcef_dll_wrapper

**Windows**

-  libcef.dll
-  libcef.lib
-  libffmpegsumo.dll
-  libcef_dll_wrapper.lib

The libcef_dll_wrapper is the directory that contains all of the cef_dll object files (within their folder heirarchy).
